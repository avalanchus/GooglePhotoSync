# GooglePhotoSync
My wife is a photographer and she is used to working with RAW. When the issue of synchronizing files with the cloud arose - our choice fell on Google Photo with unlimited space for photos, which Google Photo itself compresses. My wife has a habit of storing the resulting files (jpg) in a folder with RAW in a directory with the strange name "jeepeg" and does not intend to change her habits. Therefore, it was decided to synchronize with Google Photo to create an intermediate folder with a repeating hierarchy of source folders, in which hard links to result files of a given format (jpg, jpeg, etc.) will be created. RAW files will not sync. It was decided to do it all in the Windows service with the ability to manage it through the system tray so that during the processing of photos this service could be stopped so that different debris would not get into the cloud. A good plus in creating an intermediate synchronization folder is that deleting a hard link does not delete the source. Therefore, if a file was accidentally deleted in the cloud, it will still remain in the original folder. Enjoy it.
